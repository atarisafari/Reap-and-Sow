#Reap and Sow

  You oversee a large plot of land that’s task is to provide food for a modest kingdom, Bitland.
There are two jobs given to the serfs who help with the harvest. First are the Sowers. Each Sower
manages a horizontal parcel of land. No two Sowers’ land parcels overlap. These Sowers only
plant seeds in their given parcel. Each parcel stretches from one side of the plot of land to the
other. See the figure below of a pictorial example of Sowers land distribution.  
  
  The second role of the serf is that of a reaper. Each reaper is will harvest the crops from a
vertical parcel of land. No two Reapers’ land parcels overlap. And each parcel stretches from the
top of the plot of land to the bottom.
